## Project Description

In this project, we challenged ourselves to turn our front-end and back-end services into a monolith -- gaining a realistic experience in challenges we might face on the job.  **Next Steps** is a full-stack project that leverages the [211 API](https://apiportal.211.org) along with geolocation to assist individuals in finding community resources in their vicinity.  We thought it was particularly important to create search options catered to persons who may not have the ability to navigate existing resources.  This repository contains the front-end portion of the project which utilizes the [API](https://github.com/westonio/next-steps-back-end) provided by the back-end repository.
