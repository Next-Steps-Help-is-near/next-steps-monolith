## Project Description

**Next Steps** was a project inspired by my previous career as a social worker. It is a full-stack project that leverages the [211 API](https://apiportal.211.org) along with geolocation to assist individuals in finding community resources in their vicinity.  We thought it was particularly important to create search options catered to persons who may not have the ability to navigate existing resources.  This repo was forked and cloned from the monolith version of the group project linked above.
